							<h1>Can the Internet Be Regulated?</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/internet-regulation.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Following the terrorist attacks in London in 2017, British Prime Minister Theresa May called for countries to collaborate to regulate the internet to prevent the planning of terrorist attacks <a href="https://theconversation.com/can-the-world-ever-really-keep-terrorists-off-the-internet-78970">(link)</a>. She did not refer to any specific company, but her statements apply to large platforms such as Twitter and Facebook or smaller companies like Telegram, which offer end-to-end encrypted messaging services. Such internet regulation would include stripping down encryption to give governments access to potential terrorist attack plans. President Donald Trump echoed the importance of working with allies to stop terrorism.</p>
							<p>Internet companies and supporters disagree with May's statement suggesting that more government regulation is needed, and some argue that the types of regulations required are impossible to implement.  <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133644-theresa-mays-repeated-calls-to-ban-encryption-still-wont-work/">Timothy Revell from the New Scientist</a> argues that bans on encryption would undermine harmless uses of encryption on the internet, such as online banking, e-commerce, and protecting hospital data. The other way to give governments more access encrypted messages is giving security workers "backdoor" access. Revell argues that this is problematic because opening backdoors will make these services an easier target for hackers.</p>
							<p>While regulations that introduce security issues may be impossible, some regulation is possible, and is a big part of governance in different countries. In 2012, the Bashar Al-Assad regime shut down the internet in Syria. China blocks access to over 18,000 websites, and Yahoo banned the sale of Nazi memorabilia following a court ruling in France. In the United States, local governments have shut down cell service during protests.</p>
							<p>Groups of countries have come together in efforts to regulate the internet. The Global Privacy Enforcement Network (GPEN) works to develop practices related to internet privacy and informs websites when their privacy policies violate a country's laws. GPEN consists of representatives from over 50 countries. Similarly, countries in the EU have come together to regulate harmful messages on the internet.</p>
							<p>The United States has been pursuing global internet regulation since 2004, but has not been very successful. The most the UN has done is creating an Internet Governance Forum, which brings companies and individuals together to discuss and report on issues around internet access and free speech issues. The problem with creating a transnational body to regulate the internet is that countries rarely see eye-to-eye on issues concerning privacy and the role of government on the internet. It will be difficult and maybe impossible to legislate regulations for the internet that makes every country happy.</p>
