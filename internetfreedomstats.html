							<h1>The State of Internet Freedom Around The World</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Freedom House, a nonprofit that conducts research and advocacy on democracy, political freedom, and human rights, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/367266/the-state-of-internet-freedom-around-the-world">analyzed internet freedom in 65 countries.</a> This study particularly surrounds digital authoritarianism, which is state-led surveillance on citizens. The study found an overall rise in digital authoritarianism. </p>
							<p>Levels of internet freedom declined in 26 countries and rose in 19 countries from May 2017 to June 2018. China continues to rank the lowest in internet freedom due to mass censorship and surveillance.  China's spot at the bottom of the list is reinforced by the passing of a new Cybersecurity Law that aims to stop banned content from transmission and host data within the state. The biggest declines in freedom were in Egypt, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Kenya, Nigeria, The Philippines, and Venezuela.</p>
							<p>In the United States, internet freedom has declined because net neutrality protections have been repealed. Additionally, the FISA Amendments Act was reauthorized, which gives the government more freedom to perform broad-scale surveillance of non-US targets, which ends up collecting U.S. citizens' personal communication data in the process. </p>
							<p>The discrepancies between levels of internet freedom in different countries in the world are growing, with an overall decline in internet freedom. This could mean that the worldwide trend is for citizens to hand over their freedom. It is possible that the sweeping of data has become commonplace that people don't notice anymore.</p>
							<p>Another more likely possibility is that citizens are unaware of the status of their internet freedom. It seems, especially in the United States, that most people don't know what information of theirs is being mined. As time goes on and internet surveillance becomes more commonplace, it is likely that education about privacy in the United States will increase.</p>
							<p>Based on these statistics, the probability of global regulation on internet freedom looks unlikely. The state of internet freedom in different countries is largely dependent on how democratic the country is, particularly how much influence the government has over the people. In less democratic countries, governments have the opportunity to take full control over what internet traffic actually reaches people. In more democratic countries, that would be a political tragedy. Similarly, some countries and cultures value individual privacy much more than others. Because internet freedom is on the decline in many countries, and cultures have differing values on the role of government on the internet, it will be difficult for countries to come together on global legislation that would appease all parties.</p>
