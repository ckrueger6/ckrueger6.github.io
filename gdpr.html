							<h1>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h1>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>As the internet turns toward targeted advertisements and predictive analytics, consumers are beginning to wonder what companies can extrapolate based on their data. European Union lawmakers passed a law in May 2018 called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which puts decisions about data back into the hands of consumers <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/europes-new-privacy-law-will-change-the-web-and-more/">(link).</a></p>
                            <p>GDPR focuses on making sure that users understand and consent to the data being collected about them. Companies are required to be clear about the "what" and the "why" of the collection and use of personal data, including full name, address, location data, and IP address. This law protects individuals in the 28 countries of the European Union, even if the data is processed outside any of these 28 countries.</p>
                            <p>The legislation has had profound effects on processes in businesses all over the world. Google announced that it would halt its practice of mining emails to build personalized ads. Some businesses have elected to reduce business in the European Union, such as Drawbridge, which was unsure how GDPR would impact digital advertising.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, the law has a significant impact on individual users and provides an outlet for privacy activists to advocate for their cause. The emphasis on consent will push users to reconsider how their data is and should be used on the internet, and privacy activists can push for overhauls in how large corporations handle privacy issues. Violators of GDPR can face fines of up to 4 percent of annual global revenue, which gives companies an ultimatum to fix some questionable practices. </p>
                            <p>The effects of GDPR in the long term will depend on how consumers choose to take advantage of it. Trends in Western countries show that interest in privacy is increasing: the use of ad-blockers and VPNs is rising. Companies are responding to this in their products. In August 2018, Mozilla released Firefox Focus, a private browser for mobile, and Apple has added tracking prevention to Safari. </p>
                            <p>Despite the fact that GDPR was legislated for only 28 countries, dozens of countries around the world are responding to it and changing their practices as a result. This shows the ripple effect a region's legislation can have on business practices and the effect the law can have on the direction of the internet. While many argue that it's impossible to impose global regulation on the internet, it is possible that enough regional legislation can be passed such that internet companies, and eventually the internet itself, will bend to follow the rules.</p>
