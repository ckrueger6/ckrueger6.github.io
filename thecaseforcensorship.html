                There is continual debate on the degree to which information should be free on the internet. The United States exercises internet censorship in the form of removing intellectual property infringements and child pornagraphy on websites. In addition, the United States allows for private corporations like Facebook to remove hate speech and articles it deems as not credible. Although most citizens of the United States do not take issue to this censorship, many other countries around the world have much less restricted internet. On the flip side, many other nation states have made the internet far more restricted. There are justifiable arguments for different degrees of internet censorship.

                Proponents of censorship argue that it is necessary to prevent dangerous or illegal content from reaching citizens. Examples of this include suppressing child pornography, suppressing traffic from an enemy nation, or stopping traffic that could harm the government regime via conflicting ideologies or cyberattacks. Another dimension of freedom of information is the flow of citizenâ€™s data to external entities like corporations and the government. Many individuals today advocate for regulating this flow of information to guarantee user privacy.

                Free internet advocates state that censorship should be limited because the internet should be treated as free forum to promote democracy. These individuals fear that censorship opens the possibility of a surveillance state, where the government has control over everything citizens see on the internet. They state that free internet limits the abilities for governments to push their agenda by opening citizens to the whole breadth of global opinions.

                These arguments are essential to keep in mind when looking at the international trends regarding the freedom of information. The ever-changing landscape of internet freedom is dictated by this debate and its underlying <a href="./governmentinfoethics.html">ethical principles</a>.
