							<h1>Censoring the Competition</h1>

							<p>The fragmentation of the internet with regards to censorship and privacy laws in different countries leads to increased barriers to entry in international markets. <a href = "https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact1_e.htm">The World Trade Organization</a> exists to facilitate international trade agreements and liberalize world trade. The foundation of WTO is the WTO agreements, which were negotiated and signed by many of the world’s trading nations. These documents provide the legal basics for international trade. The WTO’s purpose is to help trade flow as freely as possible.</p>
							<p>China’s historically communist government and associated closed economy kept China from becoming a founding member of the WTO. China has been a member of the WTO since 2001, and to do so signed many agreements lowering tariffs and other barriers to entry - considerably liberalizing its own economy, but these agreements were made before the internet became a major area for trade. China claims that its motives for online censorship are for the good of the people - protecting the public from harmful information (often, anti-government information). Less officially, China’s censorship laws protect Chinese internet businesses from competition. The lack of competition in China leads to the dominance of services like WeChat, which have had some extreme privacy violations. Without competing services to turn to, Chinese consumers are forced to put up with indiscretions or go without social media as the Chinese government buys their data from the only available platform. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/opinion/china-censorship-internet.html">(Source)</a></p>
							<p>The internet creates the possibility of a global economy that we could never have imagined previously. Trade deals could be organized between continents as easily as between neighbors, and communication between countries has never been easier. The internet provides a real opportunity for countries to work together to resolve shortages and surpluses, and creates the possibility of a wider consumer base than ever for businesses - but here falls short. The fragmentation of the internet creates barriers to entry - US companies meeting US laws would love to extend their user base to China and beyond, but they are unable to because of the different regulations overseas - GDPR in Europe presents the internet’s newest fragment. It’s costly and complicated for companies to fragment their services. Companies have to pick and choose what to offer to which country, and hire consultants to make certain they aren’t breaking any locally specific laws. This lowers the internet's efficiency and value and increases the costs to businesses and their consumers.</p>
