							<h1>Ethics of Government Intervention on the Internet</h1>

                            <p>One of the most difficult problems when concerning international trends of freedom of information in the electronic commons are conflicting ethical perspectives. In the case of freedom of information, perspectives vary depending on the ethical framework one adopts, as well as the cultural and political trends of the area. What kind of role should governments have in the way information is disseminated on the internet? The remainder of this article addresses this question from the deontological, act-utilitarian, and rule-utilitarian ethical frameworks.</p>
                            <p>Those who adopt the deontological perspective must justify that it is either inherently good or inherently bad for the government to control how consumers use the internet. Some might argue that it is the duty of government to protect citizens, and use this argument to justify any government action, regardless of the result. Deontologists may also argue that it's the duty of the individual to decide how they present themselves on the internet. Different countries have taken actions to support both of these perspectives. For example, countries like China with harsh firewalls can argue that it is the duty of the government to control what content reaches individuals. The European Union recently passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is designed to give control to individuals in how their data is used, which supports the idea that the individual should get to make all decisions about their personal data.</p>
                            <p>In the deontological point of view, the result of an action does not matter if the intent was morally right. However, cultural and political circumstances have a significant influence on what people view as morally correct. For example, the relationship between the people and the government is significantly different between China and countries in the European Union. Political influences might move lawmakers in China to be more restrictive than other countries in what people can see on the internet.</p>
                            <p>Similar logic can be applied when analyzing the role of government from a rule-utilitarian perspective. Western countries generally place more importance on individual liberty, while Eastern countries tend to emphasize groups. In the West, because individual prosperity is valued, there may exist an ethical rule for laws to promote the individual. Promoting individuality is the rule that leads to the greatest good, and this likely influences the decision-making of lawmakers. This shared ethical framework may have influenced lawmakers to pass GDPR, which returns the power to make decisions about data to individual consumers.</p>
                            <p>Finally, from an act-utilitarian perspective, a person should evaluate each act individually in terms of what will bring the most good to the most people. From this perspective, one might argue that the government should have a large role in how the internet should operate because legislation is meant to make an impact on a large scale. However, time will only tell whether or not government involvement on the internet is a positive thing, because existing government intervention has existed for too little time to determine its net impact on people.</p>
