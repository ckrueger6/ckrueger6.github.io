							<h1>How do we unite the internet?</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The internet is currently fractured, broken into smaller subsets of controlled connection. People are cut off from each other for one reason or another: trade laws, censorship and unfriendly relationships between nations insulate consumers from one another and from information. </p>
							<p>American corporations such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook advocate for the globalization of internet policies to benefit the global economy and consumer access to resources. Nations advocate for their right to protect their citizens from online dangers as they see fit. Possibly the greatest challenge world leaders face in the internet age is the struggle between nationalism (here meaning the individual sense of each nation, its culture, and its values) and the ever-increasing contact between nations leading to internationalist sentiments (here referring to the spread of culture and ideas between nations creating feelings that nations may not need to be as distinct as they once were). Can nations compromise to take advantage of the internet as a global resource rather than a national one? What would be the motivation? </p>
							<p>The world faces many problems that could potentially be solved by international cooperation - nations are working separately to end war, world hunger, poverty, and disease. The internet provides a platform for people of all nations to come together, learn from and with each other, exchange resources, and work to build a better future. However, the internet is currently barred from reaching its full potential as it cannot function as a perfect platform for collaboration between all nations when the governments of those nations do not cooperate. </p>
							<p>World leaders would require some impetus to actually compromise the current national good for the global good, but once they were convinced of the necessity of a globally connected and consistent internet, they might seek solutions. One possible solution for compromise would be the power of an impartial body of governance for the internet (establishing the internet as practically a nation all its own in the world of politics). Another might be a unanimously approved updated United Nations treaty outlining terms of use for the internet. Any solution would require certain accommodations by countries on either side of the censorship debate - at minimum, the United States would probably have to accept and support that other governments have the ability to censor anti-government information in their areas, and China would have to accept citizens having greater possibility of access to sometimes censored information. </p>
							<p>No matter what conclusion is reached, any move toward global consensus on internet policy will benefit businesses, who no longer would need to spend time and money on meeting many individual sets of standards. Any move toward global consensus will benefit the consumer, with greater access to a wider array of resources and products stimulating innovation and lowering prices. Finally, any move toward global consensus will benefit world collaboration, as the more common ground our nations hold, the more we can work together. </p>
